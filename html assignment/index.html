         <p><b></b>Shri Krishna was a Vasudev. Vasudev means he enjoys everything in this world, yet he is worthy of moksha. A Vasudev has extraordinary super human energies and accomplishments. They are so powerful that thousands of people can be moved to fear by mere look in their eyes.

            Lord Krishna had sixteen thousand queens and yet he was a naishthik brahmachari. It means in him there was a constant inner intent of devotion towards celibacy (brahmacharya).</b></p>
